<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of EnvirOmix is to provide a suite of functions for the
analysis of environmental and multiomics data. This is the companion
package for the book [Integrating Multi-Omics with Environmental data
for Precision Health](https://goodrich-lab.github.io/multiomics_book/).
It contains all of the functions and data required to run all of the
examples in the book.

## Installation

You can install EnvirOmix from
[GitHub](https://github.com/Goodrich-Lab/EnvirOmix) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("Goodrich-Lab/EnvirOmix")
```

## Examples

Please see the companion book (access
[here](https://goodrich-lab.github.io/multiomics_book/)) for detailed
examples of how to use the functions in this package.
