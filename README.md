The goal of EnvirOmix is to provide a suite of functions for the
analysis of environmental and multiomics data. This is the companion
package for the book [Integrating Multi-Omics with Environmental data
for Precision Health](https://goodrich-lab.github.io/multiomics_book/).
It contains all of the functions and data required to run all of the
examples in the book.

## Installation

[GitHub](https://github.com/Goodrich-Lab/EnvirOmix) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")

```

## Examples

Please see the companion book (access
[here](https://goodrich-lab.github.io/multiomics_book/)) for detailed
examples of how to use the functions in this package.
