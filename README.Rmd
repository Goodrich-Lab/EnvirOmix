The goal of EnvirOmix is to provide a suite of functions for the analysis of environmental and multiomics data. This is the companion package for the book [Integrating Multi-Omics with Environmental data for Precision Health](https://goodrich-lab.github.io/multiomics_book/). It contains all of the functions and data required to run all of the examples in the book.

## Installation

You can install EnvirOmix from [GitHub](https://github.com/Goodrich-Lab/EnvirOmix) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("Goodrich-Lab/EnvirOmix")
```

**NOTE:** If you receive an error message during installation that the package
"qvalue" is not found, please install it manually with:

``` r
if (!require("BiocManager", quietly = TRUE))
    install.packages("BiocManager")

BiocManager::install("qvalue")
```


## Examples

Please see the companion book (access [here](https://goodrich-lab.github.io/multiomics_book/)) for detailed examples of how to use the functions in this package.
